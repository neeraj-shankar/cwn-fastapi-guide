# FAST API Documentation

## Basic API

### Phase 1: Basics

1. **Introduction to FastAPI**
   - Understand what FastAPI is and its key features.
   - Install FastAPI and Uvicorn.

2. **Creating Your First API**
   - Set up a basic FastAPI project.
   - Create simple GET and POST endpoints.
   - Run the application using Uvicorn.

3. **Interactive API Documentation**
   - Explore the automatically generated Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation.
   - Understand how to use these tools for testing and documentation.

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts

4. **Path Parameters and Query Parameters**
   - Learn how to use path parameters and query parameters in your endpoints.
   - Understand type hints and how they help with validation and documentation.

5. **Request Body and Pydantic Models**
   - Use Pydantic models to validate request bodies.
   - Understand how to handle different data types and nested models.

6. **Response Models**
   - Define response models to structure the output of your endpoints.
   - Use Pydantic models for response validation.

7. **Error Handling**
   - Implement custom error handling.
   - Use HTTPException for raising HTTP errors.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

8. **Dependency Injection**
   - Understand the concept of dependency injection.
   - Use FastAPI's dependency injection system to manage dependencies.

9. **Security**
   - Implement basic authentication and authorization.
   - Use OAuth2 and JWT for more advanced security mechanisms.

10. **Background Tasks**
    - Learn how to run background tasks.
    - Understand use cases for background processing.

11. **WebSockets**
    - Implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication.

12. **GraphQL**
    - Integrate GraphQL with FastAPI using libraries like `graphene`.

### Phase 4: Performance and Optimization

13. **Asynchronous Programming**
    - Understand the importance of asynchronous programming.
    - Convert synchronous endpoints to asynchronous ones.

14. **Testing**
    - Write unit tests for your FastAPI application.
    - Use tools like `pytest` and `httpx` for testing.

15. **Performance Tuning**
    - Optimize your FastAPI application for better performance.
    - Use tools like `uvicorn` and `gunicorn` for deployment.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Scaling

16. **Deployment**
    - Deploy your FastAPI application using Docker.
    - Use cloud services like AWS, GCP, or Azure for deployment.

17. **Scaling**
    - Implement horizontal and vertical scaling.
    - Use load balancers and other tools to manage traffic.

18. **Monitoring and Logging**
    - Set up monitoring and logging for your application.
    - Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.

### Phase 6: Community and Contribution

19. **Community Involvement**
    - Join the FastAPI community on GitHub, Reddit, and other platforms.
    - Contribute to open-source FastAPI projects.

20. **Continuous Learning**
    - Keep up with the latest updates and best practices.
    - Follow FastAPI's official documentation and blog.
